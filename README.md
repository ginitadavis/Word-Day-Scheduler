# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a workday scheduler calendar that shows the current calendar day with the date at the top, and the standard business hours of 9 am to 5 pm. The user can enter an activity and save it. Then refresh the page and the activity will still be there.

I was motivated to practice what I have learned through the week about JQuery and Dayjs, and feel more comfortable programming in javascript.

## Usage

![alt text](assets/images/Work-scheduler-img.png)

The calendar shows the office hours of 9 am to 5 pm. The user can click any of the rows, enter an activity, and save the changes clicking the save button on the right of the row.
The changes are saved to the localStorage, therefore, even if the user refreshes the page, the data is not going to disappear.

The calendar rows will show green if the event is in the future, red if the event is in the present, and gray if the event is in the past.
